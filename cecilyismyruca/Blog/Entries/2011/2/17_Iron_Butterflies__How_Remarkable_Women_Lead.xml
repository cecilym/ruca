    <richText>Ever feel like you&#x2019;re walking uphill both ways? I do... quite often. While the challenge itself makes me proud of the work I am doing, I take solace in the wise, encouraging words of women who have come before me. I&#x2019;d like to thank Sheri Graner Ray for sending this article to the Women in Game Development mailing this. In the article, Dawn Reiss discusses some key points from Dr. Birute Regine&#x2019;s book, &lt;i&gt;Iron Butterflies: How Remarkable Women Lead&lt;/i&gt;. Here are Birute&#x2019;s Four C&#x2019;s to Becoming an Iron Butterfly. &#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;1. &#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; to Your Passion.&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;A lot of people are doing work they aren&#x2019;t passionate about. It&#x2019;s important to connect with something you are passionate about even if it is as hobby.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;2. &#xA0;Collaborate with Women as a Way of Healing.&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;Collaboration enables you to compete. There is a lot of distrust among women, but instead of being worried about betrayal, try to trust. Successful influential women always have a large support network.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;3. &#xA0;Recognize Feminine Power as a Collective Power&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#x201C;The world of collaboration is all new territory. That is what is Obama trying to do,&#x201D; Regine says. &#x201C;It requires a lot of self reflection, openness and it requires going beyond yourself. It is asking what is the common benefit for both of us? We are at a tipping point and moving from a domination-based society to a more collaborative one. There is the myth that you need to do it alone and be more effective.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;4. &#xA0;Have a Sense of Community and Find the Connectors&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;Know that you are part of a movement that is happening. On the average, most women are leading the way and often don&#x2019;t realize they are part of something bigger. Most women show collaborative leadership. It is leadership that is done behind closed doors through mutual empowerment where there&#x2019;s not a lot of chest pounding. It&#x2019;s important for companies to find those connectors and start rewarding them.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Check out the article by clicking this link: &lt;a href="http://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/lifestyle/article/iron-butterflies-how-remarkable-women-lead-dawn-reiss?cid=rs-gambd-2011Booming-Outbrain"&gt;Iron Butterflies: How Remarkable Women Lead.&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;Stay strong, Butterflies!</richText>
