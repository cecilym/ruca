    <richText>I am in San Francisco for Jeff and Kane&#x2019;s conference, Mastering Wealth Through Relationships, aka &#x201C;Release Your Inner Rockstar&#x201D;. Kane has been mentoring me with my ongoing projects in the music and game industry and he set me up for a little meeting today with Christine Comaford, the badass internationally renowned business woman who&#x2019;s early accomplishments include making 10 million in tech without even graduating from high school. To get ready for our meeting I read her book,&lt;i&gt; Rules for Renegads&lt;/i&gt;, which I totally recommend. She gives away some reeeeaaally useful business planning documents here on this website:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;a href="http://rulesforrenegades.com/resources.html"&gt;http://rulesforrenegades.com/resources.html&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;I just got out of our meeting and I am so honored to have met this inspiring woman. She gave me some great advice about my game that I will definitely be implementing. Now, back to Jeff and Kane&#x2019;s conference... I&#x2019;ll let you know how it goes.</richText>
