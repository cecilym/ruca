    <richText>It hadn&#x2019;t even been 24 hours since Jeff and Kane&#x2019;s seminar ended and already the dreams, visions, and goals I worked on over the weekend began to manifest. One thing I clarified this weekend is that I would like to teach more dance classes per week because I love getting paid to exercise while being held accountable for showing up to the class. Yesterday I received two beautiful phone calls while I was at the airport about to fly back to Seattle. The first phone call was from a fitness coordinator at Vision Quest Fitness downtown asking me if I could teach two more dance classes. The second phone call was from Bruce, an extremely talented drummer I know asking if I was interested in being lead singer for a new band. You bet I am. I&#x2019;m meeting with the other musicians on Friday to see if we click. &#xD;&#xD;Above photo was taken on Thanksgiving by my aunt, Magali, a photographer who lives in Ashland, OR. Love it! Thanks, Magali!&#xD;</richText>
