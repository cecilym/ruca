    <richText>Tonight I&#x2019;m gonna see Lorn, Mochipet, the Great Mundane and some of cats are spin at Chop Suey. The last times I saw Lorn and Mochipet the dance party was epic so I&#x2019;m definitely looking forward to the show. There&#x2019;s a lot going on town tonight but I still think we are gonna pack the house. Shlomo is doing an after hours at Space so that will be a cool way to bring everyone together who didn&#x2019;t want to miss his set. &#xD;&#xD;A lot of people were complaining that Seattle music promoters were booking competing shows on the same nights so I created a public Seattle Music Promoters calendar on google. Yea, there&#x2019;s nwtekno, but it seems to me a cluttered information source for people on the planning side of the industry. I thought a google calendar would be a simpler, more elegant way for people in the industry to get brass tacks info they should know before booking their events.  Promoters can post artists, venue, set times, label/promo company, etc. Here is a link to my calendar: &#xD;&#xD;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?hl=en&amp;tab=wc&amp;pli=1&amp;gsessionid=StwvDcgLancKxPW7DJJvEQ"&gt;https://www.google.com/calendar/render?hl=en&amp;tab=wc&amp;pli=1&amp;gsessionid=StwvDcgLancKxPW7DJJvEQ&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
