    <richText>Waiting on a quite suburban street corner waiting for Blayne to pick me up earlier tonight, a man and a dog named Darwin walked by. Darwin stopped dead in his tracks, sat down on his hind legs and eagerly stared at me from the sidewalk as his owner tried to keep moving along as they had been walking away.&#xD;&#xD;&#x201C;My dog would really like to meet you.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;&#x201C;Um, oh. OK...&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;I pet Darwin and told him not to worry, that my friend was just down the road coming. I pointed to the lights of Blayne&#x2019;s car in the distance and told him that I was OK. This seemed to satisfy him because he got up willingly and joined the side of his owner who said that I had made Darwin&#x2019;s day.&#xD;&#xD;Thanks for looking out for me, Darwin. You made my day.&#xD;&#xD;* * * * &#xD;&#xD;Softly now doth I forsaketh &#xD;Alone in the dark &#xD;No regrets come to light&#xD;The bedside table where I place it&#xD;The sword, the shield rest for the night&#xD;&#xD;This game requires so many pieces &#xD;The board must be set up just so&#xD;No one doubts the players&#x2019; reason&#xD;Most simply do not dare to go&#xD;&#xD;Heavily now do my eyes linger&#xD;On the nearly finished page&#xD;Tears of relief and something colder&#xD;Symptoms of the day and age&#xD;&#xD;&lt;i&gt;Standing on the roof&#xD;Complaining to the moon&#xD;The only time I tell the truth is when &#xD;I&#x2019;m naked in my bedroom&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;Now I know what he meant&#xD;Free or Dead&#xD;This my self atonement&#xD;Sweet surrender &#xD;When I can just be me instead&#xD;</richText>
