    <richText>I want to write a FAT JUICY  long run down right now but I don&#x2019;t have much time because I&#x2019;m about to go to Trinity for free dubstep Thursdays. Yesterday I had two photo shoots. One was planned weeks in advance with a paid professional photographer at a gorgeous luxurious location. The other was planned last minute with Cozmic Danger and their roommates in their bachelor abode. Guess which photos I adore?&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;ve been looking for some guiding stars. There were so many good things flying into my life at one time I was spinning wheels for a minute. &#xD;&#xD;Off to dubstep. I hope you know what that means. If not I encourage you to check it out. Details and photos to come. &#xD;&#xD;For now, here is a mysterious parting gift&#xD;&#xD;http://www.livestrong.com/article/14699-improving-assertive-behavior/</richText>
